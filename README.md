Slider 2D
This tool is meant to provide a two dimensional slider that will always return a value between 0% and 100% on either the x or y axis for each handle. This allows you to multiply any range you want by the output, thus having a completely resizable input element without any rounding or pixel size errors.

Additionally, different handles can be linked, allowing their bounds to be modified by the linked handles' position.
